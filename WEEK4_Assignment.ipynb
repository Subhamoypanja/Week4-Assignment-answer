He wants to test his team with respect to their strength in arrays.As part of the skill testing, the task is as follows. You are given an array of integers of size N. Consider all its contiguous subarrays of length k and find the maximum sum. Do this for all k from 1 to the length of the input array. Write a program to evaluate the task done by the kids.\n",

The sub-array with maximum sum is [3]. So result[0] = 3. of K = 2, each subarray will have 2 elements. The sub-array with maximum sum is [1,3]. So result[1] = 4. of K = 3, each subarray will have 3 elements. The sub-array with maximum sum is [2,1,3]. So result[2] = 6. of K = 4, each subarray will have 4 elements. The sub-array with maximum sum is [-1,2,1,3]. So result[1] = 5. of K = 5, each subarray will have 5 elements. The sub-array with maximum sum is [-1,2,1,3,-2]. So result[1] = 3.
